## About me 
I'm an electrical engineering student fascinated by wireless technology and robotics. My passion lies in exploring the intersection between mechanical and electrical systems, and I love working on projects that require both skill sets.

I'm constantly wanting to learn new skills and this drives me to eagerly pursue projects that push my limits. I believe that my continuous desire to learn helps keep me adaptable and constantly improving. When I'm not working on new projects or completing coursework, I can often be found creating digital art or going on a jog. I'm also passionate about culture and language, and enjoy capturing photos of places around the world.

##ðŸš€ Professional Goal
I plan on pursuing a career that allows me to work on cutting edge technologies, primarily with a research or field work focus.

In pursuing this career path, I am motivated by the potential to make a positive impact on people's lives. Whether it's through designing new medical devices, creating sustainable energy solutions, or developing cutting-edge wireless technologies, I look forward to building a career that I am passionate about and that allows me to make a difference in the world.
