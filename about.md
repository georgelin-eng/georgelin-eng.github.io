## About me
I'm a mechanical engineering student with a keen interest in mechatronics and telecommunications. My passion lies in exploring the intersection between mechanical and electrical systems, and I love working on projects that require both skill sets.

I have always been fascinated by electronics, circuit design, and electromagnetic physics. I find antenna design particularly interesting and enjoy learning new things about it. As a result, I have pursued courses in electronics and telecommunications, which have helped me develop my skills and knowledge in these areas.

In addition to my passion for electronics and mechatronics, I also have project experience with CAD and analysis tools. I have a solid understanding of 3D modeling and design using software such as SolidWorks and AutoCAD, which has allowed me to create detailed and accurate models for various mechanical systems. Furthermore, I have experience with simulation software such as ANSYS and MATLAB, which I have used to analyze and optimize mechanical designs.
