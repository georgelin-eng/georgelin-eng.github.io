## About me
I'm a mechanical engineering student fascinated by wireless technology and mechatronics. My passion lies in exploring the intersection between mechanical and electrical systems, and I love working on projects that require both skill sets (a strange mix of hardware and physics for sure,s but one that I've loved developing).

I'm constantly wanting to learn new skills and this drives me to eagerly pursue projects that push my limits. I enjoy seeking new experineces, meeting new people, and learning more about the world that I live in. I belive that my continuous desire to learn helps keep me adaptable and constantly improving

When I'm not exploring the intersection of mechanical and electrical systems or pursuing new projects, I can often be found creating digital art or going on a jog. I'm also passionate about culture and language, and enjoy capturing photos of places around the world.

I plan to on using on pursuing a career that lies at the intersection of mechatronics and wireless technologies. To do this, I'm looking for experiences that require me to apply both electrical and mechanical engineering skills. 

In pursuing this career path, I am motivated by the potential to make a positive impact on people's lives. Whether it's through designing new medical devices, creating sustainable energy solutions, or developing cutting-edge wireless technologies, I look forward to building a career that I am passionate about and that allows me to make a difference in the world.
